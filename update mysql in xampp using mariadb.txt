Backup Existing Data:
Stop Apache and MariaDB (MySQL) services in the XAMPP Control Panel.
Navigate to your XAMPP installation directory (e.g., C:\xampp).
Rename the mysql folder to mysql_old (or any other name to signify it's the old version).
Create a backup of your databases by copying the data folder from mysql_old to a safe location.
Download New MariaDB Version:
Visit the official MariaDB website and download the desired stable version of MariaDB for Windows (ZIP archive, not the installer). Ensure you select the correct architecture (32-bit or 64-bit) for your system.
Integrate New MariaDB:
Extract the contents of the downloaded MariaDB ZIP file into your XAMPP directory. 
Rename the extracted MariaDB folder (e.g., mariadb-11.x.x-winx64) to mysql. This new mysql folder will now house the updated MariaDB.
Migrate Configuration and Data:
Copy the my.ini file from xampp\mysql_old\bin to xampp\mysql\bin. 
Copy the backup and scripts folders from xampp\mysql_old to xampp\mysql. 
Copy the data folder (containing your databases) from xampp\mysql_old to xampp\mysql. If the new MariaDB version has a different data directory structure, you might need to copy individual database folders from mysql_old\data to mysql\data. 
Configure and Upgrade:
Open xampp\mysql\bin\my.ini in a text editor. 
Review and adjust any necessary configurations, such as port numbers or data directory paths, to match your environment and the new MariaDB version's requirements.
Start Apache and MariaDB (MySQL) from the XAMPP Control Panel.
Open a command prompt as administrator and navigate to xampp\mysql\bin.
Run the MariaDB upgrade utility:
Code

        mysql_upgrade.exe
This command will upgrade the database tables to be compatible with the new MariaDB version.
Verify and Finalize:
Restart Apache and MariaDB (MySQL) in the XAMPP Control Panel.
Verify the updated MariaDB version through phpMyAdmin or by running mysql -V in the command prompt.
Confirm that your applications and databases are functioning correctly with the new MariaDB version.
