# Model Quality Assessment Framework
## Medicine Ordering System - Forecasting Analytics

### Overview
This document outlines how we determine if a forecasting model is "good," "excellent," etc., based on evaluation metrics and business context in our medicine ordering system.

## Key Evaluation Metrics

### 1. **AIC (Akaike Information Criterion)**
- **Lower is better** (penalizes complexity)
- **Excellent**: AIC < 1000
- **Good**: AIC 1000-2000
- **Fair**: AIC 2000-3000
- **Poor**: AIC > 3000

### 2. **BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion)**
- **Lower is better** (stronger penalty for complexity than AIC)
- **Excellent**: BIC < 1000
- **Good**: BIC 1000-2000
- **Fair**: BIC 2000-3000
- **Poor**: BIC > 3000

### 3. **RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)**
- **Lower is better** (measures prediction accuracy)
- **Excellent**: RMSE < 10% of mean demand
- **Good**: RMSE 10-20% of mean demand
- **Fair**: RMSE 20-30% of mean demand
- **Poor**: RMSE > 30% of mean demand

### 4. **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**
- **Lower is better** (average prediction error)
- **Excellent**: MAE < 5% of mean demand
- **Good**: MAE 5-15% of mean demand
- **Fair**: MAE 15-25% of mean demand
- **Poor**: MAE > 25% of mean demand

### 5. **MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)**
- **Lower is better** (percentage-based error)
- **Excellent**: MAPE < 5%
- **Good**: MAPE 5-15%
- **Fair**: MAPE 15-25%
- **Poor**: MAPE > 25%

## Model Quality Assessment Framework

### **Excellent Model**
- AIC < 1000, BIC < 1000
- MAPE < 5%, RMSE < 10% of mean
- Consistent performance across different time periods
- Handles seasonality and trends well
- Low variance in predictions
- **Business Impact**: Highly reliable for critical decisions

### **Good Model**
- AIC 1000-2000, BIC 1000-2000
- MAPE 5-15%, RMSE 10-20% of mean
- Generally reliable predictions
- Some minor inconsistencies
- Acceptable for business decisions
- **Business Impact**: Reliable for most operational decisions

### **Fair Model**
- AIC 2000-3000, BIC 2000-3000
- MAPE 15-25%, RMSE 20-30% of mean
- Useful but with limitations
- May struggle with complex patterns
- Requires careful interpretation
- **Business Impact**: Use with caution, supplement with expert judgment

### **Poor Model**
- AIC > 3000, BIC > 3000
- MAPE > 25%, RMSE > 30% of mean
- Unreliable predictions
- Not suitable for business decisions
- Needs data improvement or different approach
- **Business Impact**: Not recommended for operational use

## Data Quality Factors

### **Sufficient Data Points**
- **Daily forecasts**: At least 30 data points
- **Weekly forecasts**: At least 12 data points (3 months)
- **Monthly forecasts**: At least 6 data points (6 months)
- **Seasonal data**: Full seasonal cycles (e.g., 12 months for yearly seasonality)

### **Data Consistency**
- **No major gaps**: Missing data < 10% of total
- **Outlier handling**: Extreme values identified and treated
- **Data integrity**: Consistent units and time periods
- **Completeness**: All required fields populated

### **Pattern Recognition**
- **Seasonal patterns**: Clear recurring cycles
- **Trend stability**: Consistent growth/decline patterns
- **Stationarity**: Data suitable for ARIMA modeling
- **No structural breaks**: No sudden changes in data patterns

## Model Selection Criteria

### **Auto ARIMA Advantages**
- Automatically selects best parameters (p, d, q)
- Handles seasonality and trends
- Robust to different data patterns
- Built-in model validation

### **Cross-Validation**
- **Time series split**: Train on historical, test on recent data
- **Walk-forward validation**: Rolling window approach
- **Out-of-sample testing**: Validate on completely unseen data
- **Performance consistency**: Stable across different time periods

### **Residual Analysis**
- **White noise**: Residuals should be random
- **No autocorrelation**: Ljung-Box test p-value > 0.05
- **Normal distribution**: Shapiro-Wilk test for normality
- **Homoscedasticity**: Constant variance across time

## Business Context Considerations

### **Medicine Criticality**
- **Critical medicines**: Require higher accuracy (MAPE < 10%)
- **Essential medicines**: Moderate accuracy acceptable (MAPE < 15%)
- **Non-critical items**: Can tolerate higher errors (MAPE < 20%)
- **Luxury items**: Flexible accuracy requirements

### **Lead Time Impact**
- **Short lead times** (1-2 weeks): Higher accuracy needed
- **Medium lead times** (1-2 months): Moderate accuracy acceptable
- **Long lead times** (3+ months): Some error tolerance

### **Cost of Errors**
- **Overstock costs**: Storage, expiration, capital tied up
- **Stockout costs**: Lost sales, customer satisfaction, emergency orders
- **Service level targets**: 95%+ availability for critical items

## Implementation in Our System

### **Quality Scoring Algorithm**
```python
def _evaluate_model_quality(self, aic, bic, rmse, mae, mape):
    """Evaluate model quality based on multiple metrics"""
    quality_score = 0
    
    # AIC/BIC scoring (lower is better)
    if aic < 1000: quality_score += 2
    elif aic < 2000: quality_score += 1
    
    if bic < 1000: quality_score += 2
    elif bic < 2000: quality_score += 1
    
    # Error metrics scoring (lower is better)
    if mape < 5: quality_score += 3
    elif mape < 15: quality_score += 2
    elif mape < 25: quality_score += 1
    
    if rmse < 10: quality_score += 2
    elif rmse < 20: quality_score += 1
    
    # Overall quality assessment
    if quality_score >= 8: return "Excellent"
    elif quality_score >= 6: return "Good"
    elif quality_score >= 4: return "Fair"
    else: return "Poor"
```

### **Auto-Selection Algorithm**
Our system automatically selects the best model using a composite score:
```python
composite_score = (
    forecast.mape * 0.4 +  # 40% weight for MAPE
    (forecast.rmse / max(historical_data['quantity'].mean(), 1)) * 100 * 0.3 +  # 30% weight for normalized RMSE
    forecast.aic / 1000 * 0.2 +  # 20% weight for AIC (normalized)
    forecast.bic / 1000 * 0.1    # 10% weight for BIC (normalized)
)
```

## Best Practices

### **Model Development**
1. **Use multiple metrics**: Don't rely on just one measure
2. **Consider business context**: What accuracy level is acceptable?
3. **Test on out-of-sample data**: Validate on unseen data
4. **Monitor over time**: Model performance can degrade
5. **Regular updates**: Retrain models with new data

### **Model Comparison**
1. **Test different approaches**: ARIMA, exponential smoothing, etc.
2. **Ensemble methods**: Combine multiple models
3. **Feature engineering**: Add relevant external factors
4. **Hyperparameter tuning**: Optimize model parameters

### **Quality Assurance**
1. **Data validation**: Ensure data quality before modeling
2. **Model validation**: Test on multiple time periods
3. **Sensitivity analysis**: Test model robustness
4. **Documentation**: Record model assumptions and limitations

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### **Performance Tracking**
- **Monthly reports**: Model performance summaries
- **Trend analysis**: Identify performance degradation
- **Benchmarking**: Compare against industry standards
- **Continuous improvement**: Iterative model enhancement

### **Alert System**
- **Quality thresholds**: Automatic alerts for poor performance
- **Data quality alerts**: Missing or inconsistent data
- **Model drift detection**: Significant performance changes
- **System health monitoring**: Overall forecasting system status

### **Model Lifecycle**
1. **Development**: Initial model creation and validation
2. **Deployment**: Production implementation
3. **Monitoring**: Ongoing performance tracking
4. **Maintenance**: Regular updates and improvements
5. **Retirement**: Model replacement when needed

## Conclusion

Model quality assessment is a multi-dimensional process that combines statistical metrics with business context. The key is finding the right balance between accuracy and complexity while considering your specific business needs and data characteristics. Regular monitoring and maintenance ensure that forecasting models continue to provide value over time.

Remember: A model that's "good enough" for your business context is often better than a perfect model that's too complex to maintain or understand.
